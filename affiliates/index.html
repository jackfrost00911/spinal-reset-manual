Subject: Is your head weighing 60lbs?

If you sit at a desk for more than 4 hours a day, I have some bad news.

You might think your head weighs about 10 or 12 pounds. And you’d be right... technically.

But a new study shows that for every inch your head drifts forward to look at a screen, gravity effectively doubles the weight on your spine.

By the time you look down at your phone, your neck is holding up 60 POUNDS of pressure.

This is why your shoulders burn.
This is why you get those headaches behind your eyes.
And this is why your posture looks like a "hunchback" in photos.

You can't fix this by forcing yourself to "sit up straight." Your muscles are too exhausted to hold it.

Instead, you need to hit the "Reset" button on your nervous system.

There is a simple, 15-minute ritual that releases the "protective tension" in your neck and aligns your head instantly.

No chiropractors. No gym. Just you, a doorway, and 15 minutes.

Subject: The "Text Neck" Epidemic

Do you ever catch yourself in a photo or the mirror and think... "Wow, why am I slouching so much?"

It’s called "Forward Head Posture," or Tech-Neck.

And unfortunately, it doesn't just look bad. It cuts off oxygen to your brain, causes chronic fatigue, and can lead to permanent spinal damage if you ignore it.

Most people try to fix it by buying expensive ergonomic chairs or aggressive back braces.

But the problem isn't your chair. It's your Fascia.

Your body has "shrink-wrapped" itself into that hunched position to protect you. To fix it, you need to gently convince your nervous system to let go.

I recently found a protocol called The 15-Minute Spinal Reset.

It’s a 21-day video system designed specifically for desk workers and drivers. It uses gentle somatic movements to dissolve 10 years of tension in just a few weeks.

It also comes with a specific "Migraine Melter" trick that stops tension headaches in about 3 minutes. (I use this one almost every day).

Subject: 15 minutes to fix your neck?

Quick question: Does your neck hurt right now?

If you are looking at a screen, you are probably hunching.

My friend just released a new program called **The 15-Minute Spinal Reset**. It is specifically designed to reverse "Tech Neck" and forward head posture without going to the gym.

If you want to stop that burning pain in your traps/shoulders, you need to see this video.

It’s currently on sale for the price of a cheap dinner.
